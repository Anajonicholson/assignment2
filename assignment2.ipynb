    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? \n",
    "  \n",
    "      This paper fouses on the difficulties in tidying data and how from the outside it can be complicated. It goes into detail about the key tools needed to be used during data cleaning to create a more consistent data structure to clean messy data efficiently. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      The \"tidy data standard\" was designed to take the tools needed for cleaning data and simplifying them to bring them together. It removes the necessity of starting from scratch every time. \n",
    "      \n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "      The first sentence is referencing how all tidy data contains three things; each variable forms a column, each observation froms a row, and each observational unit forms a table. Messy data, on the other hand, can be any other arrangement, meaning that there is no limit to how messy the data is. The second sentence means that when comparing all of the variables and observations, it can be difficult to determine which is what because they can fall into subcategories. It is the most easy to compare variables rather than rows, and observations rather than columns. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      Values: qualitative (strings) or quantitative (numbers).\n",
    "      Variables: One variable will contain all of the values that measure a single attribute (can use multiple units).\n",
    "      Observations: One observation will contain all values that are measured on the same unit across multiple attributes. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      Tidy data contains columns and tables that are matched up with the respective observations, variables, and types. Variable --> column, observation --> row, observational unit --> table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      The five most common problems according to section 3:\n",
    "      • Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
    "      • Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
    "      • Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
    "      • Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
    "      • A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
    "      Data in table 4 is considered messy because the rows and the columns both contain variables, and the column headers are values instead of variable neames. Melting a data set is turning the columns into rows for cleaning purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      Table 11 is messy because the headers of the columns are values, while table 12 has column headers of variable names of which the values are shown below. In other words, they melted the data set by changing the column headers into the rows. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      The chicken and egg problem is that tidying data requires the data tidying tools, and the data tidying tools are only focused on tidying data, so working with each of these things individually may never improve the work. He hopes that in the future these tools can be improved and the framework can be continuously developed. "

These kinds of data are necessary to notice in politics and society because an even distribution of race across jobs and other activities is desired. Data quality matters because the answers are not always black and white, there are a lot of middle grounds and the data can be skewed one way or another if it is not collected and organized properly. \n",

Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I think that the Census tried to do a good job on collecting more data by adding a second question, however I think that there should just be one question and it should allow people to choose the level at which they are each thing (for example, 50% white, 50% black, 100% female). This allows the mixture of each identity to be an option and the diversity to be better reflected.\n",

I think that the sex given at birth is a necessary question to ask but there should also be another question with a variety of answers and spectrums for each person to place their identiy within (similar to above). There are lots of people who identify differently than their given sex and it is a little bit naive for the question to be overlooked. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    It is more difficult to clean data that is correct because there are so many aspects that can fall into one person. That is why I think it should be a spectrum because then these can be turned into numbers or proportions within each person. Those that are 0% white will just have a 0 in that category, which diminishes the missing values. People may want to put the data into boxes, but the reality is that there are very few people who are just one thing. \n",
